# Embed the canonical sources into the scripts that are fetched and piped to a
# shell.
#
# install.sh and install.ps1 are downloaded and executed in one line, so at run
# time they have no repo to read from: whatever they need has to live inside the
# script itself. The canonical copies are still ordinary files — the package
# lists under deps/, the inner scripts under inner/ — and this script renders
# them into the generated blocks of their consumers. `--check` re-renders and
# fails when a committed block no longer matches, so the copies cannot drift.
#
# Two stages, in order (stage 1 feeds stage 2):
#   1. deps/*.txt                -> inner/slicer-deps
#   2. inner/slicer-language     -> install.sh
#      inner/slicer-deps         -> install.sh
#      inner/slicer-language.ps1 -> install.ps1
#
# Usage:
#   tools/sync-embedded.sh            rewrite every generated block
#   tools/sync-embedded.sh --check    exit 1 (with a diff) if any is out of date
